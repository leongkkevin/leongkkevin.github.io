# 3D Modeling and Animation

Along with my ventures in computer science and software development, I also have found an interest in 3D modeling and animation. Using <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?support=ADVANCED&plc=MAYA&term=1-YEAR&quantity=1">Autodesk's Maya</a>, I developed knowledge about modeling, simulations, and rendering. More information on my 3D modeling projects are shown below:

### Modeling

### Rigging
### Animation
### Simulations
