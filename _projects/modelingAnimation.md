# 3D Modeling and Animation

Inspired by the beauty and realism of Pixar's *Toy Story 4*, I wanted to dive deep into learning the technical skills and aesthetic designs of 3D Modeling and Animation. Using <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?support=ADVANCED&plc=MAYA&term=1-YEAR&quantity=1">Autodesk's Maya</a>, I developed knowledge about modeling, simulations, and rendering. More information on my 3D modeling projects are shown below:

* [**Link's Sword and Shield**]({{site.baseurl}}/Link_Sword_and_Shield/) <br>
    *Modeled the sword and shield for the character Link from one of my favorite retro video games Legend of Zelda*

* [**7-11 Logo**]({{site.baseurl}}/Seven_Eleven_Logo/) <br>
    *Created a 3D animation for 7-11's famous logo from a simple image*

* [**Pixar's Lamp**]({{site.baseurl}}/Pixar_Lamp/) <br>
    *Rigged and animated one of Pixar's most iconic character*

<!---

* [**MASH Particles**]({{site.baseurl}}/MASH_Particles/) <br>
    *Utilized Arnold's built in MASH functions to create pulse, trail, and outline particle effects*

-->

* [**Pirate Flag**]({{site.baseurl}}/Pirate_Flag/) <br>
    *Modeled and simulated a pirate flag billowing in the wind using Maya's nCloth Dynamics*

* [**The Dancing Knight**]({{site.baseurl}}/Dancing_Knight/) <br>
    *Created choreography with a dancing knight using Mixamo animations and characters*

* [**Mr. Roboto**]({{site.baseurl}}/Robot_Render/) <br>
    *Staged and lighted a beautiful model of a futuristic-looking robot*

Learning about modeling, rigging, animation, and much more really made me appreciate the time and effort that goes into creating everything from the online video games I play to huge-budget animated feature films that I watch. To think I have only scratched the surface of this amazing craft! I had a lot of fun making these projects and I am excited to develop my skills and make more in the future.
