# 3D Modeling and Animation

Along with my ventures in computer science and software development, I also have found an interest in 3D modeling and animation. Using <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?support=ADVANCED&plc=MAYA&term=1-YEAR&quantity=1">Autodesk's Maya</a>, I developed knowledge about modeling, simulations, and rendering. More information on my 3D modeling projects are shown below:

* [**Link's Sword and Shield**]({{site.baseurl}}/Link_Sword_and_Shield/) <br>
    *Modeled the sword and shield for the character Link from one of my favorite retro video games Legend of Zelda*

* [**7-11 Logo**]({{site.baseurl}}/Seven_Eleven_Logo/) <br>
    *Created a 3D animation for 7-11's famous logo from a simple image*

* [**Pixar's Lamp**]({{site.baseurl}}/Pixar_Lamp/) <br>
    *Rigged and animated one of Pixar's most iconic character*

<!---

* [**MASH Particles**]({{site.baseurl}}/MASH_Particles/) <br>
    *Utilized Arnold's built in MASH functions to create pulse, trail, and outline particle effects*

* [**Pirate Flag**]({{site.baseurl}}/Pirate_Flag/) <br>
    *Modeled and simulated a pirate flag billowing in the wind using Maya's N-Cloth Dynamics*

-->

* [**The Dancing Knight**]({{site.baseurl}}/Dancing_Knight/) <br>
    *Created choreography with a dancing knight using Mixamo animations and characters*

* [**Mr. Roboto**]({{site.baseurl}}/Robot_Render/) <br>
    *Staged and lighted a beautiful model of a futuristic-looking robot*

This exploration into 3D modeling and animation, while a part of my Creative Computing B.A., was something I had always found interesting since I was a small child. Veing fascinated by Disney and Pixar, I always wanted to get a look at the behind-the-scenes of those stunning animated films. 

Diving into modeling, rigging, animation, and much more really made me appreciate the time and effort that goes into everything from the online video games I play to huge-budget animated Pixar feature films that are shown worldwide. To think I have only scratched the surface of this amazing craft! I had a lot of fun making these projects and I am excited to make more in the future.
