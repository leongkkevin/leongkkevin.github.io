# About This Website

This website was created entirely from scratch via Jekyll, and Github pages. This consisted of creating several Markdown and HTML/CSS files and folders in order to create a functioning site. The formatting, layout, and text were all created by me. 

I thought that creating a website would be a fun project to do over Fall of 2020, as I had never done front-end computer science before. Doing some Google searches and watching some simple Youtube videos, I was able to learn a lot of HTML/CSS in order to make the website the way it is now.
