# COVID-19 Search Engine

This project is a culmination of an entire semester's C++ learning. In this project, a partner and I utilized <a href="https://github.com/SMUCSE2341/search-engine-timmins-leong/tree/master/rapidjson">rapidJSON</a> to parse through 12,000 articles in order to create an inverse file index of words (stored in a <a href="https://github.com/SMUCSE2341/search-engine-timmins-leong/blob/master/DSTree.h">custom AVL Tree class</a>) and an index of authors (stored in a <a href="https://github.com/SMUCSE2341/search-engine-timmins-leong/blob/master/DSHashTable.h">custom HashTable class</a>). **This algorithm's speed was ranked in the top 25% of the course's students**.
