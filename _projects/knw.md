# Introduction to Engineering Design

Introduction to Engineering Design is a team-based course in which a group of 4 or 5 students design and create an automous robot that completes a variety of tasks. Specifically, the robot was tasked to navigate a maze and take a salinity reading (from 0% to 1%). I assisted with the design and construction of the machine as well as the development of a fully calibrated salinity sensor. However, when the COVID-19 pandemic spread our team across the nation, I spearheaded the data collection and team organization of the team. I utilized my experience in Microsoft Excel and knowledge in statistics to efficiently collect and analyze all testing and calibration data from both the robot navigation team and the salinity team.

*Here is the CAD model for our robot's design:*

Not only did the class require a variety of mechanical skills, it also demanded time management skills. As the team's coordinator and created a detiled Gantt chart to organize the team's efforts. As well as this, I ensured that the team not only met the set deadlines, but also the requirements of the project.

*Below is the Gantt chart created in Microsoft Excel:*

I now work as a teaching assistant for the class, providing mechanical knowledge and assistance. During this time, I  developed a more accurate salinity sensor which can detect 0% to 0.001% salinity percentages.

Not only this, I act as a teaming advisor, helping resolve issues between teammates and groups. I really enjoy this position as not only do I get to learn more about several different disciplines of engineering, but I also get to help my peers accel in engineering design
