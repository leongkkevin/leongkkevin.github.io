# Screenwriting

As Pixar's Co-Creator and Disney Animation's President Ed Catmull once said, "Story is King." Whether it be on the page or on the big screen, having a compelling and genuine story will make or break any piece of creative work. <br>

Knowing this, I fell in love with the art of storytelling and writing. Since January of 2020, I have developed scripts for two short films (shown below). Each of which, through several drafts and teacher mentorship, are slowly becoming finished works. <br>

## Invisible Boy - *Spring 2020*
Being my first project, I wanted to write something close to my heart. Inspired by my own high school experiences, I wrote a short film about a transparent teenager trying to win over the heart of a girl.

## Thicker than Water - *Fall 2020*
This project, I wanted to try another type of story - something more dramatic. Influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, I developed a story about a family being constrained by both mysterious monsters and each other.
