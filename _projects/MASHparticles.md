# MASH Particles

An aspect 3D modeling that I found especially interesting is special effects. In this age of huge blockbuster movies, being able to add out-of-this-world experiences only adds to increasing the audience's attention to the big screen. Luckily for me, Maya's plugin - MASH - helps create motion graphics and certain visual effects quite easily. In this project, I created three particle effects: Trail, Outline, and Pulse.

## Trail

## Outline

## Pulse
