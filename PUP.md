# Hello Pixar Hiring Manager,

Welcome to my Pixar Undergraduate Program Portfolio! 

Below I have broken down what I believe is my best work creatively and technically. 
Please click on any link to learn more about that specific project.

I hope you enjoy.

## Visual Excellence

Below are links to two script excerpts for two of my favorite animated short films I developed: 

* [**The Foreigner**]({{site.baseurl}}/The_Foreigner/) - *Spring to Fall 2021* <br>
    *Inspired by my parent's story of immigrating to America, this animated short follows an immigrant to a foreign land, trying to find his way home.* 

* [**Invisible Boy**]({{site.baseurl}}/Invisible_Boy/) - *Spring 2020* <br>
    *Inspired by my own high school experiences, I wrote an animated short about a transparent teenager trying to win over the heart of a girl.*

## Technical Excellence

Here are some links to my recent technical programming projects:

* [***Introduction to Engineering Design***]({{site.baseurl}}/knw/) - *Spring 2019 - C++* <br>
    Created an **autonomous, multi-tooled robot** that can navigate a maze and collect salinity and inclinometer data.

* [***COVID-19 Search Engine***]({{site.baseurl}}/COVID_Search_Engine/) - *Fall 2020 - C++* <br> 
    Developed a **research database boolean query** search engine about the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Museum Holography Research Project - *Spring 2022*

I think this project will be a fantastic combination of my visual and technical proficiencies. 

Working with the **Fort Worth Museum of Science and History**, I am currently aiding them in developing **Looking Glass holographic displays**.
Not only will this project have me **modeling, animating, and rendering 3D scenes**, I will also be troubleshooting new technology and helping with **developing a workflow** for using these displays.

Thus far, the museum team and I are in early stages of developing and testing the hologram's practical applications. 
We are working on researching proper hardware for the display and plug-in compatibilities with different modeling software.

Later in this job, I will have experience working in **Unreal Engine** and **Unity** to design holographic scenes.
I will also be working with the museum team to **design a museum experience** best suited for guests that effectively captures the power of these holographic displays.

## Thank you very much for this opportunity! 
### I look forward to hearing from you soon.
