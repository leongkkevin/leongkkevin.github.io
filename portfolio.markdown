Here are some creative experiences and that I have explored. Please click on any link to learn more. 

* [**Screenwriting**]({{site.baseurl}}/Screenwriting/) <br> 
*Spring 2019 to Fall 2020 - Final Draft* <br>
Developed and edited scripts for two short films

* [**3D Modeling and Animation**]({{site.baseurl}}/Modeling_and_Animation/) <br> 
*Spring 2019 - Autodesk Maya*<br>
Delve deep into different 3D Modeling and Animation principles and skills. 

* **Sound and Code** <br>
*Spring 2021 - Max MS* <br>
Currently working on sound engineering projects

The more I discover the limitless possibilities of writing and animation, the more excited I get about developing my skills in the industry. As Ed Catmull says in his book *Creativity Inc.*, "Donâ€™t wait for things to be perfect before you share them with others." Here I want to share my work, hoping to find new opportunities to gain experience and grow both as an artist and as an individual.
