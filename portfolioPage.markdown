Here are some creative experiences that I have explored. Please click on any link to learn more about that project. 

## 3D Modeling and Animation
*Spring 2019 - Autodesk Maya*<br>

Delve deep into different 3D Modeling and Animation principles and skills.

* [**Mr. Roboto**]({{site.baseurl}}/Robot_Render/) <br>
    *Staged and lighted a beautiful model of a futuristic-looking robot*

* [**The Dancing Knight**]({{site.baseurl}}/Dancing_Knight/) <br>
    *Created choreography with a dancing knight using Mixamo animations and characters*

* [**Pirate Flag**]({{site.baseurl}}/Pirate_Flag/) <br>
    *Modeled and simulated a pirate flag billowing in the wind using Maya's nCloth Dynamics*

* [**Luxo Jr.**]({{site.baseurl}}/Pixar_Lamp/) <br>
    *Rigged and animated one of Pixar's most iconic character*

* [**7-11 Logo**]({{site.baseurl}}/Seven_Eleven_Logo/) <br>
    *Created a 3D animation for 7-11's famous logo from a simple image*

* [**MASH Particles**]({{site.baseurl}}/MASH_Particles/) <br>
    *Utilized Arnold's built in MASH functions to create pulse, trail, and outline particle effects*

* [**Link's Sword and Shield**]({{site.baseurl}}/Link_Sword_and_Shield/) <br>
    *Modeled the sword and shield for the character Link from one of my favorite retro video games Legend of Zelda*
<br>

## Screenwriting
*Spring 2019 to Fall 2020 - Final Draft* <br>
Developed and edited scripts for two short films

* [**Invisible Boy**]({{site.baseurl}}/Invisible_Boy/) - *Spring 2020* <br>
Inspired by my own high school experiences, I wrote an animated short about a transparent teenager trying to win over the heart of a girl.

* [**Thicker than Water**]({{site.baseurl}}/Thicker_than_Water/) - *Fall 2020* <br>
Influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, I developed a short film about a family being constrained by both mysterious monsters and each other. 


## Sound and Code
*Spring 2021 - Max MS* <br>
* Currently working on sound engineering projects

<br>
The more I discover the limitless possibilities of writing and animation, the more excited I get about developing my skills in the industry. As Ed Catmull says in his book *Creativity Inc.*, "Donâ€™t wait for things to be perfect before you share them with others." Here I want to share my work, hoping to find new opportunities to gain experience and grow both as an artist and as an individual.
