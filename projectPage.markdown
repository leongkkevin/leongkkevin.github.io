# Engineering Projects:

Here are some of the Computer Science based projects I have completed. Please click on any link to view more.

* [***Introduction to Engineering Design***]({{site.baseurl}}/knw/) <br>
    *Spring 2019 - C++* <br>
    Created an autonomous, multi-tooled robot

* [***COVID-19 Search Engine***]({{site.baseurl}}/COVID_Search_Engine/) <br> 
    *Fall 2020 - C++* <br> 
    Developed a research database boolean query search engine about the COVID-19 pandemic

* [***Sentiment Analyzer***]({{site.baseurl}}/sentimentAnalysis/) <br>
    *Fall 2020 - C++* <br>
    Identifies the sentiment of words in movie reviews

* [***Flight Planner***]({{site.baseurl}}/flightPlan/) <br>
    *Fall 2020 - C++* <br>
    Helps find the most efficient routes between two cities

* [***Auto Indexer***]({{site.baseurl}}/autoIndex/) <br>
   *Fall 2020 - C++* <br>
   Made an algorithm that creates an index of words from a formatted text

* [***Block Chain***]({{site.baseurl}}/blockChainNetwork/) <br>
    *Spring 2019 - C++* <br>
    Simulated a block chain network and creates a ledger between three networks

Along with detailed engineering projects, I also have a <a href="https://kevinkleong.medium.com/the-rope-86eed6130fe7"> published Medium article </a> about the Rope Data Structure.

Computer science is not "just code." The more I finished programming projects and developed my coding skills, the more I realized that studying computer science has taught me a way of logical problem solving that no other area of study can develop. Even developing and coding this website, I ran into troubles that were probably distinct to only my code. Yet, through the skills I learned from my classes and the projects above, I managed to fix them.
