When I'm not coding or studying, I spend most of my time staying active - either swimming or playing volleyball with friends at the gym. To relax, I enjoy sitting back and strumming my guitar. 

I am looking forward to learning more about the Computer Science field and gaining practical knowledge about working in the industry through internships and job opportunities. Please do not hesitate to reach out!

I hope to hear from you soon!
