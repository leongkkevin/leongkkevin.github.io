When I'm not coding or studying, I spend most of my time staying active - either swimming or playing volleyball with friends at the gym. To relax, I enjoy sitting back, reading a good book, and strumming my guitar. 

I am looking forward to gaining practical knowledge about working in a creative and innovative industry through internships and job opportunities. Please do not hesitate to reach out!

I hope to hear from you soon.
